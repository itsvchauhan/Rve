# HUVTSP Rove_x3t Internship Project - Flight Data Collector

A Python script that collects flight data using the Amadeus API for multiple travel routes and stores the data in a CSV file. Optionally, you can export the CSV data to a local SQLite database.

## Features

- ‚úàÔ∏è Connects to Amadeus API to fetch real-time flight data
- üó∫Ô∏è Pre-configured with multiple international travel routes
- üìä Collects comprehensive flight information (prices, airlines, times, dates)
- üíæ Stores data in a CSV file (no SQL by default)
- üóÑÔ∏è Optionally exports CSV data to SQLite database (`database.db`)
- üìà Provides data analysis and statistics
- üîÑ Automatic rate limiting to respect API limits

## Travel Routes

The script collects data for these routes:
1. **Madrid to Barcelona** (MAD ‚Üí BCN)
2. **New York to Los Angeles** (JFK ‚Üí LAX)
3. **Berlin to Paris** (BER ‚Üí PAR)
4. **London to San Francisco** (LON ‚Üí SFO)

## Date Range

- The script collects flight data for **2025-08-01** through **2025-08-04** for each route.

## Data

- **On a testing environment, all retrieved data is not real. If real data is needed, applying for the production environment in Amadeus is necessary.**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Amadeus API Credentials
1. Visit [Amadeus for Developers](https://developers.amadeus.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new application to get your API Key and Secret

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:
```
AMADEUS_API_KEY=your_amadeus_api_key_here
AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your_amadeus_api_secret_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Script
```bash
python main.py
```

## What the Script Does

1. **Initialization**: Connects to Amadeus API
2. **Data Collection**: For each route, searches flights for 2025-08-01 to 2025-08-04
3. **Data Storage**: Saves flight details to a CSV file (`flight_data_export.csv`)
4. **Analysis**: Provides statistics about collected data
5. **Optional SQL Export**: Converts the CSV file to a SQLite database (`database.db`)

## Output Files

- `flight_data_export.csv` - CSV export of all data
- `database.db` - SQLite database (if you choose to export)
- `flight_data_collection.log` - Detailed execution log

## Optional: Export CSV to SQLite

After the CSV is generated, the script will automatically convert it to a SQLite database (`database.db`) with a table named `flight_data_sql`.

## Example Output

```
=== FLIGHT DATA STATISTICS ===
Total flights collected: 12

=== FLIGHTS BY ROUTE ===
                        price_amount                
route_name             currency    count  min    max    mean                
Madrid to Barcelona      EUR         3    45.0   90.0   60.00
New York to Los Angeles  USD         4    120.0  350.0  200.00
...

=== TOP AIRLINES BY FLIGHT COUNT ===
            price_amount         
airline_name          count    mean       
Delta Air Lines         4     210.00
American Airlines       3     180.00
...
```

## Troubleshooting

- **API Errors**: Check your credentials in `.env` file
- **Sandbox Limitations**: The Amadeus sandbox only supports a limited set of routes and dates. If you get a 400 error, try a different route or date.
- **Network Issues**: Script includes retry logic for temporary failures
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Notes

- Data collection is limited by the Amadeus sandbox environment for free accounts
- **On a testing environment, all retrieved data is not real. If real data is needed, applying for the production environment in Amadeus is necessary.**
- The script is designed to be run multiple times safely (prevents duplicates in the CSV/SQL)
- All times are in UTC as provided by Amadeus API
- The code is now clean, efficient, and free of comments for maximum clarity and performance
